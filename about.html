			<h1>About Me.</h1>
			<p>
			My name is Grant Glomstead. I am a 22 year old student at Michigan State University and am majoring in Media and Information with a minor in Information Technology. I was born in an average, little town called Waterford MI, and attended Our Lady of the Lakes catholic schools in grades K-8. After that, I switched to Clarkston High School, and enrolled in Clarkston Science Math and Technology Academy (CSMTech). CSMTech is a program through Clarkston High School which focuses on advanced courses in these areas, and teaches students in a accelerated, proactive environment. It was here where I learned how to code in several languages, and use various technologies and programs that they had at their disposal. Upon graduating in 2013, I attended Michigan State University, and continued my studies in technology. <br><br>
			During my sophomore year, I landed a job in the technology department of the Communications Arts and Science building, which is home to some of the most advanced equipment at MSU. With this job, I managed to balance my studies with a busy work schedule, and gained experience with new technology while operating in a professional business environment. The CAS building is home to over 3000 computers, several motion capture studios, virtual reality units, film studios, 3D printers, and much more. At work I continued to learn and problem solve on all these devices, as well as learn several new programs. Through my time at this job, I have been promoted twice, and look forward to continuing to excel my field until I graduate. <br><br>
			After graduation, I plan on furthering my education at Oakland University by getting a masters degree in software engineering. So far, throughout my education I have amassed a knowledge of several programming languages such as: HTML, CSS, PHP, JAVA, SQL, Python, C++, C#, and Visual Basic. I have also become fluent with an array of programs such as: Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects, Unity, Visual Studio, and others. I am also capable of operating in Windows, Mac, and Linux. Furthermore, I have a sincere interest in the arts, such as writing, drawing, painting, and editing videos. You can view my various projects both in the work, and arts tabs at the top of the page.
